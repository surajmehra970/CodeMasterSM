  introduction: "A Singly Linked List is a linear data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations, which gives them advantages for certain operations like insertions and deletions. Singly linked lists are fundamental to understanding more complex data structures and are frequently asked about in technical interviews.",
