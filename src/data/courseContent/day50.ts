  introduction: "This module explores the intersection of microservices architecture and database design. Microservices architecture enables building complex applications as a suite of small, independent services, while database selection and design are critical for each service's performance and scalability. We'll examine strategies for database selection, data consistency patterns, and communication between microservices, providing practical patterns for building resilient, maintainable distributed systems.",

          explanation: "This code demonstrates security implementation in a microservices architecture. The JWT configuration shows how to secure service endpoints with token-based authentication and role-based authorization. The database security section illustrates how to protect sensitive data through encryption at the persistence layer. The service authentication filter demonstrates secure service-to-service communication using API keys. Together, these components form a multi-layered security approach that protects both the services and their data."

      question: "Design a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform, focusing on the database choices for each service. Justify your database selections based on the specific requirements of each service.",
      solution: "Create distinct microservices for: 1) Products (MongoDB for flexible schema to handle varying product attributes and categories), 2) User Profiles (PostgreSQL for relational data with personal information), 3) Orders (PostgreSQL with transactions for financial consistency), 4) Inventory (Redis for high-speed availability checks), 5) Search (Elasticsearch for full-text product search), 6) Reviews (MongoDB for schema flexibility and document storage), 7) Cart (Redis for high performance and time-limited data), and 8) Payments (PostgreSQL for ACID transactions and financial audit trails). Connect services via REST for queries and Kafka for events like order creation, inventory updates, etc. Implement API Gateway for client access and service discovery using Consul or Eureka."

      question: "Implement a Saga pattern for a flight booking system that involves multiple services: flight reservation, payment processing, seat allocation, and notification. Detail how you would handle compensation transactions if any step fails.",
      solution: "Implement a choreography-based Saga with event-driven communication. Each service publishes events and subscribes to relevant events from other services. If the payment service fails after flight reservation, it publishes a PaymentFailedEvent, triggering the flight service to release the reservation by listening to this event. Similarly, if seat allocation fails, it publishes a SeatAllocationFailedEvent that triggers payment refund and flight reservation cancellation. Use a distributed event store (like Kafka) to ensure event delivery. Include a timeout mechanism for each step to handle cases where services don't respond, and implement idempotent operations to safely retry steps if needed."
    },
    {
      id: "microservices-db-hw3",
      question: "Design a strategy for handling distributed transactions across microservices that use different types of databases (SQL and NoSQL). Focus on maintaining data consistency without tight coupling between services.",
      solution: "Implement an event-driven architecture with the Outbox Pattern: 1) When a service performs a local transaction, it also writes events to an 'outbox' table in its database as part of the same transaction, 2) A separate Message Relay process periodically polls the outbox table and publishes events to a message broker, 3) Services that need to react to these events subscribe to the appropriate topics and perform their local transactions. Use idempotent event handlers to handle duplicate messages safely. For query consistency, implement CQRS with materialized views that are updated asynchronously based on events. Monitor data consistency with reconciliation processes that detect and resolve discrepancies."

      question: "Develop a strategy for securing sensitive customer data in a microservices architecture where customer information is accessed by multiple services. Address both data at rest and data in transit security concerns.",
      solution: "Implement a layered security approach: 1) For data at rest, use column-level encryption for PII in databases, with keys managed by a dedicated key management service, 2) For data in transit, use mutual TLS between services and encrypt all external communications, 3) Create a dedicated Identity Service that acts as the system of record for customer data, with other services storing only customer IDs and requesting sensitive data via secure APIs when needed, 4) Implement attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained authorization, 5) Use API gateways to enforce consistent authentication, 6) Maintain audit logs for all access to sensitive data, 7) Implement data minimization principles by limiting which services can access full customer profiles, and 8) Use token-based data access with short-lived tokens for temporary access to sensitive information."

  quiz: [
    {
      id: "microservices-db-q1",
      question: "Which database characteristic is most important for a microservice that processes financial transactions?",
      options: [
        "Schema flexibility",
        "Full-text search capabilities",
        "ACID transaction support",
        "Geographic distribution"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "ACID transaction support is the most important database characteristic for financial transaction processing because it ensures Atomicity (transactions are all-or-nothing), Consistency (transactions bring the database from one valid state to another), Isolation (concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other), and Durability (completed transactions survive system failures). These properties are essential for maintaining financial data integrity and preventing issues like double-spending or lost transactions."

    {
      id: "microservices-db-q2",
      question: "Which communication pattern is most appropriate for a microservices scenario where multiple services need to react to an event but the originating service doesn't need to wait for their responses?",
      options: [
        "Synchronous REST API calls",
        "Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)",
        "Request-response over HTTP",
        "Asynchronous event publishing"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: "Asynchronous event publishing is most appropriate when multiple services need to react to an event without the originating service waiting for responses. This pattern decouples the services temporally and allows them to process the event at their own pace. It's ideal for scenarios like 'order placed' events where inventory, shipping, notification, and analytics services all need to react independently without blocking the order service that published the event."

    {
      id: "microservices-db-q3",
      question: "What is the primary challenge addressed by the Saga pattern in microservices?",
      options: [
        "Service discovery and registration",
        "Distributed data queries across services",
        "Maintaining data consistency across multiple services without distributed transactions",
        "Optimizing network communication between services"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The Saga pattern primarily addresses the challenge of maintaining data consistency across multiple services without using distributed transactions. It breaks down a distributed transaction into a sequence of local transactions, each with compensating transactions that can be executed if a step fails. This allows microservices to maintain their data independence while still ensuring overall business process consistency."

    {
      id: "microservices-db-q4",
      question: "In a microservices architecture using the Database-per-Service pattern, what is the recommended approach for handling queries that need data from multiple services?",
      options: [
        "Create a shared database that all services can access",
        "Use distributed transactions across service databases",
        "Implement API Composition or CQRS with materialized views",
        "Allow services to directly query other services' databases"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Implementing API Composition or CQRS with materialized views is the recommended approach for handling queries that need data from multiple services. API Composition aggregates data from multiple services in real-time through their APIs, while CQRS with materialized views maintains read-optimized views of data that span multiple services. Both approaches respect service boundaries and data ownership, unlike shared databases or direct cross-service database access which create tight coupling."

      id: "microservices-db-q5",
      question: "Which security practice is most effective for protecting sensitive data when multiple microservices need access to it?",
      options: [
        "Using a shared encryption key across all microservices",
        "Implementing a dedicated service for sensitive data with strict access controls",
        "Duplicating encrypted data across all services that need it",
        "Storing sensitive data only in memory, never in databases"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Implementing a dedicated service for sensitive data with strict access controls is the most effective practice for protecting sensitive information in a microservices architecture. This approach centralizes security concerns, minimizes the exposure surface area, enables comprehensive auditing, and allows for fine-grained access controls. It ensures that sensitive data is managed consistently and that each service only accesses the specific data it needs through controlled interfaces."
