When accessing an item, move it to the front of the list. When adding a new item to a full cache, remove the item at the end of the list (least recently used)."

      solution: "Use a min-heap (priority queue) to efficiently merge the lists. Initialize the heap with the first element from each list. Repeatedly extract the minimum element, add it to the result list, and insert the next element from that list into the heap if available. This approach has O(N log k) time complexity where N is the total number of elements and k is the number of lists."

      solution: "Use Kadane's algorithm to find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum. Track the current sum and the maximum sum found so far.

      solution: "Use a Trie data structure to efficiently store the dictionary words and perform DFS on the board. For each cell in the board, start DFS if the character matches a prefix in the Trie.

  quiz: [
    {
      id: "amazon-q1",
      question: "What is the time complexity of the standard solution for the 'Number of Islands' problem?",
      options: [
        "O(n) where n is the number of cells",

        "O(mÃ—nÃ—log(mÃ—n)) where m and n are the dimensions of the grid"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The standard DFS solution for the 'Number of Islands' problem has a time complexity of O(mÃ—n) where m and n are the dimensions of the grid. This is because in the worst case, we might need to visit every cell in the grid once during the DFS traversal."

      question: "Which data structure is most appropriate for implementing a rate limiter that throttles requests based on a time window?",

        "HashMap with timestamps",
        "Binary Search Tree",
        "Linked List"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "A HashMap with timestamps is most appropriate for implementing a rate limiter. It allows O(1) lookup to check if a request should be throttled based on previous requests. The HashMap can store the message or request ID as the key and the timestamp as the value, enabling efficient rate limiting based on time windows."

        "The two-pointer approach has better cache locality",

        "The two-pointer approach requires fewer comparisons"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The two-pointer approach is more space-efficient because it uses constant O(1) extra space by tracking left and right maximums on-the-fly, instead of pre-computing and storing them in arrays which would require O(n) extra space. This optimization is important for space-constrained environments."

        "Converting the tree to a graph and applying BFS"

      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The key insight is using post-order traversal (checking left, then right, then root) and returning a node when either target node is found. If both left and right subtrees return a non-null value, then the current node is the LCA. This approach efficiently handles all cases in a single traversal."

      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "A greedy algorithm selecting jobs with the highest profit/time ratio is NOT typically used to solve the 'Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling' problem. This greedy approach fails because it doesn't account for the constraints of non-overlapping intervals. The optimal solution usually involves dynamic programming, sorting jobs by end time, and finding the latest non-overlapping job for each current job."
