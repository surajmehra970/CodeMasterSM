  introduction: "A monotonic stack is a specialized stack data structure that maintains elements in either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order. Unlike regular stacks, which only maintain the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) property, monotonic stacks enforce an additional ordering constraint. Monotonic stacks are particularly useful for solving problems that involve finding the next greater/smaller element, calculating spans, or handling histogram-related challenges. They enable efficient solutions with O(n) time complexity for problems that might otherwise require O(nÂ²) approaches.",

When adding a new element to the stack, we first remove elements that would violate the monotonic property. This means that for a monotonically increasing stack, we pop elements that are greater than the new element, and for a monotonically decreasing stack, we pop elements that are smaller than the new element.",
